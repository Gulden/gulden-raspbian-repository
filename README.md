This github repo hosts the official Gulden repository of packages for raspbian.
The intention is that this repo will have packages not only for the official GuldenD software but also for various other auxillary products or scripts, so that anyone can easily set up a Gulden related device by adding only this repository.

Examples of other packages you might find in this repo:
init scripts to automatically start/stop GuldenD at boot and keep it running
auto update scripts to automatically update GuldenD when new versions enter the repo
g-dash (web dashboard for GuldenD and witnessing devices)
